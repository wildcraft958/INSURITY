# 🚗 Telematics Insurance Platform

An AI-powered telematics insurance platform that uses expert models to assess driving risk, calculate premiums, and provide gamified driver improvement programs.

## 🎯 Overview

This platform implements a comprehensive telematics insurance solution with:

- **Multi-Expert Risk Assessment**: Combines behavior, geographic, and contextual risk models
- **Real-time Premium Calculation**: Dynamic pricing based on driving behavior and risk factors
- **Gamification Engine**: Points, badges, and challenges to encourage safe driving
- **Claims Analytics**: Industry-standard frequency and severity predictions based on PMC11386000 Section 4
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of driver performance and risk metrics

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Expert Models
1. **Behavior Expert**: Analyzes acceleration, braking, speed compliance, and phone usage
2. **Geographic Expert**: Assesses location-based risk factors and accident history
3. **Contextual Expert**: Evaluates time, weather, and traffic conditions
4. **Gating Model**: Combines expert outputs using weighted ensemble approach

### Core Components
- **Backend API** (FastAPI): Expert models, risk assessment, and business logic
- **Dashboard** (Streamlit): Interactive web interface for drivers and insurers
- **Gamification Service** (Flask): Microservice for points, badges, and leaderboards
- **Database** (Aiven Postgres): Secure, scalable data storage

## 📊 Expert Models

### Behavior Model (behavior_model.py)
- **Features**: Speed patterns, acceleration/braking behavior, phone usage
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest with feature engineering
- **Output**: Safety score (0-100, higher is better)
- **Reference**: outofskills/binary-random-forest + aggressive-behaviour analysis

### Geographic Model (geo_model.py)
- **Features**: Historical accident data, population density, road conditions
- **Algorithm**: Risk zone clustering and spatial analysis
- **Output**: Location risk score (0-100, higher is riskier)
- **Reference**: one-accident-one-life analysis

### Contextual Model (context_model.py)
- **Features**: Time of day, weather conditions, traffic density
- **Algorithm**: Multi-factor risk assessment
- **Output**: Contextual risk score (0-100, higher is riskier)
- **Reference**: traffic-accident-analytics-ml + featureengineering-safedrive

### Gating Model (gating_model.py)
- **Function**: Combines all expert outputs using weighted ensemble
- **Weights**: Behavior (40%), Geographic (30%), Contextual (30%)
- **Output**: Final risk score and premium adjustment
- **Reference**: how-can-we-prevent-road-rage (merging outputs)

## 💰 Premium Calculation

### Risk Tiers
- **Preferred** (Risk < 30): 20% discount
- **Standard Plus** (Risk 30-60): 10% discount  
- **Standard** (Risk 60-80): Base rate
- **High Risk** (Risk > 80): 30% surcharge

### Claims Analysis
Based on industry-standard actuarial models (PMC11386000 Section 4):

- **Frequency Calculation**: Age, gender, location, mileage adjustments
- **Severity Modeling**: Vehicle type, safety features, repair costs
- **Telematics Impact**: Up to 18% reduction in claim frequency
- **ROI Analysis**: Quantified savings from safe driving behavior
